# Implement the main method which runs a Black Jack game from the terminal. It should work this way:
# Card? "y" or "yes" to get a new card
# > yes
# Your score is 6, bank is 17

# Card? "y" or "yes" to get a new card
# > yes
# Your score is 16, bank is 17

# Card? "y" or "yes" to get a new card
# > yes
# Your score is 19, bank is 17

# Card? "y" or "yes" to get a new card
# > no
# You beat the bank! You win.
